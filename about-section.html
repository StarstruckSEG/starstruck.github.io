<h2>Create a space where communities can meet, grow, and thrive.</h2>
<pr> Starstruck is a communication/ music sharing/ service. Here millions of users share their common love and passion for music(?)<pr>
<h2>Our past</h2>
<pr>Starstruck as a concept was first envisionned in Ottawa, by a group of students with nothing but a dream. 
    While there is no shortage of communication services, very few center around music sharing. 
    And if they do, there are just no way to create a true community. 
    The fonders of Starstruck have lived through the creation and death of many communication services(?), 
    together they joined their favorite aspect of said communication services(?) to bring you Starstruck.</pr>
<h2>Our Present</h2>
<pr>After many iterations, and failures along the way, Starstruck as you know it was born. 
    Today, about one thousand users actively use the website. The communities that were born and currently live 
    on Starstruck have actively aided its developement, while forming bonds unique to them(?)  </pr>
<h2>Our future</h2>
<pr> As its team and community grows, Starst</pr>
